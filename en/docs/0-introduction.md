# 0 - Introduction

When we talk about take a next step as a developer, we have to understand that the code quality is always the main focus on this road.

I like to think that the difference between the Junior and the Mid level developer is how they worry about the quality of the code. The Junior Developer has the mission to **MAKE IT WORK**, while the Mid Developer worry about to make it work but focusing on the **DELIVERED CODE QUALITY**.

There is a lot of ideas of how to improve your code, like KISS (Keep it Simple), DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and the one which will be approached here: SOLID.

SOLID is an acronym to rules that makes easier the life of who is READING the code for a next mainentance, since they are like "laws" that you have to follow on Object Oriented Programming for a better code legibility and manutenbility. These principles were joined by the ~~asshole~~ Robert C. Martin, aka Uncle Bob.

This acronym has as part:

* Single Responsibility Principle
* Open-closed Principle
* Liskov's Substitution Principle
* Interface Segregation Principle
* Dependency Inversion Principle


We're going to use a very simple project representing a Twitch Chat to explain all those principles.
